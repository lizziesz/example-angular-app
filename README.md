# ExampleAngularApp

Angular Project that displays a table of data.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

I used Angular Material to help with the display of the table, and for its use of filtering/sorting. By using a Material table, it's quick to add filtering/sorting to the table.

With more time to work on this top priorities would be:

  1. Make tests pass/add more tests
  2. Add more styling (the app has basic styling at the moment, but more could be added)
    3. In particular, the styling of the "About" column needs to be addressed/thought about. 
  3. Format the "Registration" date as a more user-friendly date.

Assumed Requirements:

  For the purposes of this assignment, I displayed all the data in the HTML table, and made a judgement call to provide sorting on columns that made sense. Normally, I would want more clarification on:

    1. What data should be displayed?
    2. What data/columns should be able to be sorted?

  The table is also read-only, so you can not add/edit/remove entries - that could also be a feature added with more time.

## Quick Start

Clone the repo locally. Then:

`npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
